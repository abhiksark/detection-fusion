# DetectionFusion Advanced Ensemble Configuration
# Complete reference showing all available parameters

# Overlap configuration for box matching
overlap:
  threshold: 0.5          # IoU threshold for considering boxes as matching (0.0-1.0)
  method: "iou"           # Overlap calculation method: "iou", "giou", "diou"

# Voting configuration for consensus strategies
voting:
