# DetectionFusion GT Rectification - Custom Template
# Copy and modify this file for your specific requirements

# Rectification mode:
#   "minimize_error" - Conservative, high-precision error detection
#   "maximize_error" - Aggressive, comprehensive error detection
mode: "minimize_error"

# Path configuration
paths:
  labels_dir: "labels"           # Directory containing model prediction subdirectories
  gt_dir: "GT"                   # Directory containing ground truth labels
  images_dir: "images"           # Directory containing source images
  output_dir: "rectified_dataset"  # Output directory for rectified dataset

# Threshold configuration
thresholds:
  iou: 0.5                       # IoU threshold for matching predictions to GT (0.0-1.0)
  confidence: 0.5                # Minimum confidence threshold (0.0-1.0)
  min_agreement: 3               # Minimum number of models that must agree (>=1)

# Output configuration
output:
  most_correct: 50               # Number of most correct images to include (>=0)
  most_incorrect: 50             # Number of most incorrect images to include (>=0)
  copy_images: true              # Whether to copy source images to output directory
